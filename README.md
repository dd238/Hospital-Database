# Hospital-Database

Creates an environment for Patient, Doctor, Hospital Admin to login and allows each user to set a permission based on the login type. The database utilizes ACID integrity, which is maintained through transactions along with the use of a log file. The database is normalized using 3NF, which reduces the need for restructuring and makes the data model more informative.
